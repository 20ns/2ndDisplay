# Discovery Fix Summary - IP Address Mismatch Resolved

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **Problem Discovered:**
- **Host found Android at:** `192.168.238.1` (USB tethering network)
- **Host broadcast from:** `192.168.1.56` (main WiFi network)  
- **Android received from:** `192.168.1.56` (different network!)
- **Result:** Discovery worked but wrong IP used for connection

### **Root Cause:**
The discovery was working across networks but the connection attempt was using the wrong IP address. The host was finding the device on USB tethering (`192.168.238.x`) but broadcasting discovery from WiFi (`192.168.1.x`).

## **Fix Implemented:**

### **Changed Priority:**
1. **USB Discovery FIRST** - Use the reliable `192.168.238.1` address found via USB interface detection
2. **Network Discovery OPTIONAL** - Just for verification, not for IP addresses
3. **Direct Connection** - Connect directly to USB-discovered IP address

### **Expected Result:**
- Host finds device at `192.168.238.1` via USB discovery ✅
- Right-click tray shows "Connect to: Ethernet 3" ✅  
- Click connect → Uses `192.168.238.1` for video streaming ✅
- Android receives video on port 5004 ✅

## **Test Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Run Updated Host**
```
Location: host\build\vs2022-debug\Debug\TabDisplay.exe
Expected: Finds device at 192.168.238.1
```

### **Step 2: Connect to Device**
- Right-click tray icon
- Should see "Connect to: Ethernet 3"
- Click to connect
- Should use IP `192.168.238.1` (not WiFi network)

### **Step 3: Verify Streaming**
- Connection should succeed without touch errors
- Video streaming should start automatically  
- Android should show "Connected to 192.168.238.1"
- PC screen should appear on tablet

## **Key Logs to Watch:**

### **Host Side:**
```
[info] Successfully found Android device at: 192.168.238.1
[info] Attempting to connect to device: Ethernet 3 (192.168.238.1)
[info] Successfully connected to device: Ethernet 3
[info] Video streaming started successfully
```

### **Android Side:**
```
TabDisplay_VideoService: Connected to 192.168.238.1
TabDisplay_VideoService: Receiving: Frame [number]
```

## **Network Architecture:**

```
PC WiFi (192.168.1.x) ← Not used for connection
     │
PC USB Tethering (192.168.238.x) → Used for video streaming
     │
Android USB (192.168.238.1) → Receives video
```

## **Success Criteria:**

✅ **Discovery finds USB device at 192.168.238.1**  
✅ **Connection uses USB IP, not WiFi IP**  
✅ **Video streaming starts without errors**  
✅ **Android displays PC screen content**  

The fix prioritizes the reliable USB connection method over network discovery, ensuring the connection uses the correct IP address for your tablet!
