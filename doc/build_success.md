# Build Success Report

## Status: âœ… HOST APPLICATION BUILD SUCCESSFUL

The C++ compilation errors have been resolved:

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Moved `CaptureMode` enum declaration** before its first use in function signatures
2. **Moved `CaptureRegion` struct declaration** before its first use
3. **Added missing `#include <thread>`** for std::thread usage
4. **Removed duplicate enum/struct declarations**

### Build Output:
```
TabDisplay.vcxproj -> C:\Users\Nav\Desktop\display\host\build\vs2022-debug\Debug\TabDisplay.exe
```

### Warnings (Non-Critical):
- Unused local variable warning (primaryHeight)
- wchar_t to char conversion warnings
- Deprecated spdlog format warnings

These warnings don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Test Updated Host âœ…
The new `TabDisplay.exe` should now have improved discovery integration.

### 2. Android App Rebuild ðŸ”„
Rebuild the Android app with the new DiscoveryService:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing ðŸ”„
1. Install updated Android app on Galaxy Tab S10+
2. Connect tablet via USB tethering
3. Run new `TabDisplay.exe`
4. Check if "Galaxy_Tab_S10+" appears in device list
5. Test video streaming and touch input

## Expected Results:
- Host successfully discovers Android device
- Second monitor functionality works as intended
- Touch events properly forwarded from tablet to desktop

The core connection issue should now be resolved with both sides of the discovery protocol implemented correctly.
