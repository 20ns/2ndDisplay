# Tablet Display Project Debug Tracking

## Project Goal
Convert Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ into a second display monitor for laptop via USB-C wired connection.

## Current Status
- Android app compiles and runs (.apk)
- Host C++ code compiles and runs (.exe, shows as tray icon)
- **ISSUE**: When both are running and tablet connected via USB-C, Android app shows black screen

## Architecture
- `/android/`: Android app (receiver)
- `/host/`: C++ Windows app (sender/capturer)

## Investigation Progress

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
- [ ] Analyze Android app structure and display logic
- [ ] Analyze Host C++ capture and transmission logic
- [ ] Check communication protocol between host and android
- [ ] Verify USB/network communication setup

### Phase 2: Communication Protocol
- [ ] Verify UDP sender/receiver configuration
- [ ] Check packet format and encoding
- [ ] Analyze network discovery and connection logic

### Phase 3: Display Rendering
- [ ] Check Android surface/view setup for display
- [ ] Verify screen capture logic in host
- [ ] Check frame encoding/decoding

### Issues Found
1. **HOST: UdpSender not initialized with target address** - The UdpSender is created but never initialized with the Android device's IP address
2. **HOST: Missing connection setup** - No mechanism to discover/connect to Android device via USB tethering
3. **HOST: Capture system not fully integrated** - Tray app only shows status dialog, doesn't start actual screen capture
4. **ANDROID: Hardcoded UDP port mismatch** - Android listens on port 5004, but protocol doc shows 45678 for discovery
5. **ANDROID: No USB tethering network setup** - Android app assumes WiFi network, not USB tethering
6. **PROTOCOL: IP discovery missing** - Need USB RNDIS IP detection mechanism

### Root Cause Analysis
- Host app initializes components but never starts the actual capture/transmission pipeline
- Android app waits for UDP packets but host never sends any because UDP sender has no target IP
- Missing USB tethering network discovery to find Android device IP automatically

### Fixes Applied
1. **FIXED: Port mismatch** - Updated host to use port 5004 (matching Android) instead of 54321
2. **ADDED: USB device discovery** - Created UsbDeviceDiscovery class to automatically find Android devices via USB tethering
3. **ENHANCED: Win32 TrayApp** - Modified TrayApp_win32.cpp to integrate all capture components and auto-connection
4. **FIXED: Touch port communication** - Added touchPort field to control packets so Android knows where to send touch events
5. **INTEGRATED: Full pipeline** - Win32 tray now initializes capture, encoder, UDP sender, and input injector with proper callbacks

### Current Status
- All source code fixes implemented
- Build needs to be completed to test the fixes
- Android app ready with updated control packet handling

### Next Steps
1. Build the updated host application
2. Test USB connection and auto-discovery
3. Verify screen capture and touch input work end-to-end
